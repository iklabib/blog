I was attending Libreoffice & UbunCon Asia 2023 (LOUCA23) in Surakarta. Seven hours trip from Jakarta to Surakarta by train. I was not bored because said train was comfy enough for me to working on my programming task. Yes, I was working on my day off.

The event was held at *Universitas Sebelas Maret*. It was two days event, but because of my badly planned trip, I was in Surakarta for five days. I had my fun.

I had the pleasure of chatting with Lothar Becker, former chairman of Libreoffice about how to make people willing to migrate people from using proprietary office suite to LibreOffice. In a nutshell, the answer to my question wasÂ *when they are ready*. Understanable.

The main hall was allocated for keynote talks, aside from that there were also parallel sessions. My favorite session that I attended was "Hand's on Translating in Ubuntu" because the speaker, Syazwan was funny.

My second favorite was delivered by Herpiko Dwi Aguno, that session titled "Crafting a Native GNOME App for Ubuntu and Ship It Via Snap". FInally, I met Mr. Herpiko, I kind of looking up for him since I heard about BlankOn project. It only come to second place because of *snap*. I didn't _shot_ any good picture of this session, Sowry ðŸ¥ºðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ.

Another session that I attend was "Getting Involve with Ubuntu", turns out you can get official recognization from Ubuntu by getting Ubuntu Membership. Significant contributions required.
